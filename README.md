# Flower-Recognization

The dataset I am using here for the flower recognition task contains 4242 flower images. Data collection is based on Flickr data, google images, Yandex images. You can use this data set to recognize the flowers in the photo.

The images are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. For each class, there are approximately 800 photos. The photos are not in high resolution, approximately 320Ã—240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to one size, they have different proportions.
